# This is a fork of pet-teleport (you can literally see that above) which is meant to be compiled with spigot 1.17.1 API
The original plugin still works in 1.17.1, but the project structure bugged me out and I have decided to to reorganize, because I can.

*Felt cute, might make a pull request later*

Ever teleported somewhere in Minecraft only for your pets to not follow you? The problem is that the server instantly unloads unoccupied chunks, often with your pet in stow! This plugin ensures that standing pets teleport to you if they ever end up in an unloaded chunk.
