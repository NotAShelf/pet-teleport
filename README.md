# This is a fork of the plugin pet-teleport which I have compiled using the spigot 1.17 API.
You don't really have a reason to use this fork since the original one is as functional in 1.17.1 (probably newever versions too.)

*This fork includes a different plugin structure, maven, and an update checker to, well, check updates.0

Ever teleported somewhere in Minecraft only for your pets to not follow you? I have! The problem is that the server instantly unloads unoccupied chunks, often with your pet in stow! This plugin ensures that standing pets teleport to you if they ever end up in an unloaded chunk. Handy!

Tame your desired pets and the plugin will automatically work when you teleport. There is practically no manual input from the player required.

## Commands
None!
